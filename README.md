# About Project
This project will be an example of a SAAS platform where a user can use the services for a subscription basis. Users can get a free subscription if  they have special code generated by the admin and each code can be used the number of times set by the admin while generating the referral code. The code brings different benefits; it can provide lifetime access.

The project is a combination of all the beginner to advanced level machine learning and deep learning projects that can be used and tried by everyone. The python instance will provide the option to users to make their own code.
